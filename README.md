**Overview of the analysis:**

The purpose of this analysis was to enrich Dana's original UFO analysis. I've added additional columns to the page (city, state, country, and shape) as well as more filter search boxes for users to search against multiple criteria. 

*Here's a screenshot of what the webpage looks like with all the additional columns and search boxes:*

**Results:**
In Dana's original webpage, there was only 1 search box (date) on the left pane. In my screenshot below, I've entered "la mesa" into the *Enter the City* search box. You'll see that when you search the webpage with information that you're filtering, then the informtaion you're isolating is extracted and presented like the screenshot below:

**Summary:**

The analysis captures all reading content available for users to read on the webpage, but only has available data from the year 2010. It's fun to see the initial webpage with a picture from Nasa, but I think it'd be more fun to have real-life UFO images that people have submitted to newspapers (from the 20th century until now) imbedded into the webpage to make the webpage look less "plain".
